****Exception:::
Types of errors(handled) :
	1)Compile time errors : Which we get while compiling, these are shown on screen also like syntax errors...
		These are easy to find while compiling.
	2)Runtime error: In runtime error execution basically stops, these are called exceptions and we need to handle
		exceptions.When you try to open file, and if it doesn't exist...Dividing a number by zero...
	3)Logical errors : Errors in the logical part, apart from the above two exceptions.	


***Exceptions: RuntimeException[Unchecked Exception], SQLException, IOException....	
Checked : These are the exceptions that are checked at compile time.
Unchecked : It compiles fine, but it throws ArithmeticException when run. The compiler allows it to compile because
			ArithmeticException is an unchecked exception.


=> When executing Java code, different errors can occur: coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong 
input, or other unforeseeable things.
=> When an error occurs, Java will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: 
Java will throw an exception (throw an error).	
	=>
	The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
	The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.
	
Try-Catch multiple:
=> //you can have multiple catch statements to handle exceptions.
Always have the parent exception at last, bcz if it is at top then there no reason for giving remaining exceptions.	
	
	
#####Types of errors: Errors can't be handled
1)ThreadDeath
2)IOError
3)VirtualMachineError	
4)OutOfMemory


****These Exceptions and Errors extends the Throwable class, and the top class that gets implemented by Throwable or 
Throwable class extends Object Class.
